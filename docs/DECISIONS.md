# ADR-0001: Preserve the supplied UI as the product reference

Date: 2026-09-07
Status: Accepted

Context: The user supplied a downloaded UI prototype and requires its visual structure to be preserved.
Decision: Use `audio_studio_ui` as the primary UI/UX reference; inspect only relevant assets and maintain compact project context.
Consequences: Preserve screens and styling; simulated functionality must be replaced with real local operations.

# ADR-0002: Tauri shell with prototype-derived React source

Date: 2026-09-07
Status: Accepted

Context: Only compiled React assets exist; the app will run beside memory-intensive local audio and language models.
Decision: Use Tauri 2, Rust, React, and TypeScript; recover screen structure into maintainable source and reuse the supplied CSS. Keep native capabilities behind explicit commands and remove hosted-platform dependencies.
Consequences: The packaged shell is small and uses macOS WebKit, while native filesystem/process work is implemented and tested in Rust. The compiled bundle remains a reference, not the production extension point.

# ADR-0003: Filesystem projects and replaceable local engines

Date: 2026-09-07
Status: Accepted

Context: The requested workflow is local-first and needs interchangeable text models, durable chapters, audio assembly, and measured timestamps.
Decision: Use versioned JSON/files, llama.cpp and Ollama text adapters, a separate speech interface, installed macOS voices, imported audio, and local FFmpeg/FFprobe executables.
Consequences: No database or hosted backend; external executable availability and schema validation need explicit handling.
